            <h1><img src="Images/color-cat.png"> About Me</h1>
              <p>As a dedicated professional immersed in the ever-evolving realm of Software Product Development and Management, I balance my career with a rich and fulfilling personal life. Recently married, I've embarked on a lifelong journey with my partner, sharing our love not just with each other but also with our diverse and lively family of pets — four cats, two dogs, and our six aquariums, each a miniature ecosystem teeming with life.</p>
              <p>In the IT realm, I specialize in software analysis, app integration, and development, with strong skills in IT server management and team leadership. Outside work, my passion for organic gardening — particularly tomatoes, hot peppers, and cannabis — reflects my commitment to sustainability, blending technology with nature.</p>
              <p>Beyond my professional and gardening interests, I'm an avid disc golf enthusiast. The game's blend of skill, strategy, and outdoor activity provides a perfect escape and a way to connect with friends and nature. Whether I'm navigating the course with a disc in hand or spending time at home among my pets and aquariums, these moments of leisure and care add a fulfilling balance to my life.</p>
              <p>Though not heavily active on social media, I value genuine connections. Feel free to reach out via Email or connect with me on LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter. Let's share stories, insights, or even a round of disc golf if you're nearby.</p>
              <p>Embracing life's complexities with Peace and Love.</p>
